# Django-Evaluation-Final

### Still in progress but backend is completed with api working fine, I have tested it using postman,
So, if want to evaluate that, then you can follow these steps:

1. clone the repository.
2. create a virtual environment.
   `python -m venv myenv` for windows.
4. Install requiements.txt
   `pip install requirements.txt`
6. run the server using
   `python manage.py runserver`
7. Test the api on post man manually, for admin make sure you create a superuser, i have used that login credential instead of adding new admin auth to settings.py.
8. run clean command to remove all test data:
   `python manager.py clean_test_data`

### Thanks that is so far, working on frontend.....
